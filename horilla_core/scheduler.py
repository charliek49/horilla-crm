# horilla_core/scheduler.py

"""
Background scheduler tasks for Horilla.

This module defines periodic background jobs executed using APScheduler.
It handles maintenance and automation tasks such as:

- Updating the active fiscal year
- Cleaning up expired records from the recycle bin
- Initializing and starting the background scheduler

These tasks are intended to run continuously in the background
alongside the Django application.
